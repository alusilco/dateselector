Objetive: 
- Create a DateSelector with MUI in React with CSS3 and JavaScript.

_Description:_

The idea is develop a Date selector is for the need in forms. Sometimes we need it in form and I think that this code is very useful.
We need: 
- npm i @material-ui/pickers
- npm i @date-io/date-fns@1.x date fns
- npm i @material-ui/core

You may have problems with version but you can use --force when you install.
